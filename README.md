These are my attempts at solutions of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems using Haskell.
Their only purpose is for me to practice Haskell while I'm learning the language, whilst solving fun
problems at the same time. For that reason, this is **not** a collection of the most optimal (or even elegant)
solutions to the problems, nor does it intend to be.
